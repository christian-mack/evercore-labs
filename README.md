## Component Architecture

This project follows atomic design principles to create a scalable and maintainable component architecture. The components are organized in a hierarchical structure that reflects their complexity and reusability.

### Atomic Design Structure

```
components/
  ├── atoms/      # Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
  ├── molecules/  # Simple combinations of atoms (form groups, search bars)
  ├── organisms/  # Complex combinations of molecules and atoms (forms, tables)
  └── templates/  # Page-level layouts that contain organisms
```

### Component Categories

#### Atoms
- Basic building blocks of the interface
- Single responsibility components
- Examples: buttons, inputs, labels, icons

#### Molecules
- Simple combinations of atoms
- Form groups, search bars, navigation items
- Still relatively simple and focused

#### Organisms
- Complex combinations of molecules and atoms
- Forms, tables, navigation bars
- Handle more complex interactions and state

#### Templates
- Page-level objects that place components into a layout
- Focus on content structure rather than the content itself
- Handle complex state management and data flow
- Often include business logic and data transformation
- Examples: DashboardTemplate, LayoutTemplate

### Benefits of This Structure

1. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused across different parts of the application
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
3. **Scalability**: The structure supports growth as the application evolves
4. **Consistency**: Helps maintain consistent design patterns throughout the application
5. **Documentation**: Makes it easier for developers to understand the component hierarchy

### Guidelines for Component Placement

When creating new components, consider:
- The component's complexity
- Its reusability across the application
- The level of business logic it contains
- Its relationship with other components
- The amount of state management it requires

Place components in the appropriate directory based on these considerations to maintain a clean and organized codebase.
